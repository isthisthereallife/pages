                      <description><![CDATA[<p>The potential for a national rail strike has been looming for a long time, and now that we have finally reached the point where one could actually happen, we decided we needed to have someone who knows a lot more about the railroads than we do on the show to help explain the situation. We were very excited to be joined by Justin Roczniak from Well There’s Your Problem to bring us historical analysis of the long road to where we are today. We discuss the history of how the railroads have operated in the US, how the national freight network has been shaped by the profit motive, and how rail executives have let the entire national rail network decay in pursuit of maximum dividends. This history sets the stage for the current crisis, where companies have merged into a few mega-carriers with no real competition, and “precision scheduled railroads” have slashed rail crews and stretched their existing employees to the breaking point. We summarize the long labor process to get to this point demanded by the Railway Labor Act, and what we might see in terms of a potential long term outcome of the current dispute. With a national strike possible as soon as this Friday, we hope this discussion provides some helpful background to understand what state the railroads are in, how they got that way, and the roots of the horrific working conditions rail workers are fighting against.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>We’ve got an absolutely jam packed episode this week, labor news never stops. First, we are excited to discuss the victory of the Heine Brothers Coffee workers in their union election. Next we cover the Seattle teachers strike, where workers are fighting for resources needed to serve special education and multi-language learning students. A recent report from the Washington Post has documented the incredible work by Unite Here in unionizing 90 percent of the cafeteria workers at Google campuses across the country. The union drive at Target may have hit setbacks in Virginia but has sprung up in Pueblo, Colorado as well.  Every Hollywood production these days uses a ton of visual effects, but effects workers are some of the only non-union production workers in the business, which some are now fighting to change. The ALU grew again this week as workers organizing in Modesto, CA, announced their affiliation with the union. California passed a major new bill this past week aimed at regulating the fast food industry, we discuss the pros and potential cons of this kind of reform. A report from The Intercept this past week raised some troubling questions about the effect the “neutrality agreement” at Microsoft is having on the relationship between the union and the company, with the union killing a report that was critical of the company’s military contracts.  Finally we close out with our weekly recap of the Starbucks Workers United movement.</p>

<p>Work Stoppage is going to the movies! In this first episode of a new series, we check out some classics of labor cinema, Matewan and Cradle Will Rock. Matewan tells the story of one of the most famous battles of the Appalachian Mine Wars of the early 20th century which would culminate in the Battle of Blair Mountain shortly after. Covering the struggle of workers in West Virginia to unionize, it gives audiences a window into the absolute tyranny of the coal companies and the level of violence they were willing to use to try and prevent the unions from organizing the mines. Cradle Will Rock recounts the development of the play of the same name by the Federal Theater Project during the great depression. In whirlwind fashion, the film covers the anti-communist witch hunt to purge the Federal Theater Project, the collusion between the US ruling class and fascism, and the struggle for artistic freedom under capitalism.  We discuss the themes of the films and how we can use them as agitation tools in our organizing. On future episodes, we’ll discuss many more examples of labor cinema and how we can use them to help make workers’ struggles and their history relatable in our fight to build unions today.</p>

<p>Happy Labor Day everyone, we’ve got another packed episode of Work Stoppage. We start out with a sad follow up as yet another young organizer with the South African Shack Dwellers’ Movement has been brutally murdered. There’s no easy way to transition out of that so we move into our labor news, as the MLBPA is finally organizing the exploited minor league players. Also this week, another huge win for the independent union movement in Mexico at another auto parts manufacturing plant. Moving to a story out of Canada, workers at a construction firm have been threatened with jail for refusing “voluntary” overtime. The NLRB ruled against Tesla this week, saying they cannot bar workers from wearing clothing with union insignia on it. Nursing home workers struck in unison across multiple employers a few weeks ago in a bid to address sector wide problems.  Another major healthcare workers struggle is coming up next week, when 15,000 nurses in Minnesota will hit the picket lines. Finally, the NLRB ruled against Amazon’s frivolous challenges to the ALU’s win at JFK8, and for Labor Day the ALU and Starbucks Workers United came together for a massive rally in NYC to demand both companies recognize the unions and bargain in good faith.</p>

Nursing home workers struck in unison across multiple employers a few weeks ago in a bid to address sector wide problems.  Another major healthcare workers struggle is coming up next week, when 15,000 nurses in Minnesota will hit the picket lines. Finally, the NLRB ruled against Amazon’s frivolous challenges to the ALU’s win at JFK8, and for Labor Day the ALU and Starbucks Workers United came together for a massive rally in NYC to demand both companies recognize the unions and bargain in good faith.</p>

<p>This week we were honored to be joined by Nate Holdren, professor at Drake University and author of the recent book Injury Impoverished: Workplace Accidents, Capitalism, and Law in the Progressive Era.  In the book, Nate chronicles the shift in the way workplace injury is handled in the US from liability trials to workers compensation. We discuss the dehumanizing aspects of both systems and the ideology used to justify the devaluing of working class life. We also discuss Nate's work on Engels' concept of Social Murder, and how that concept is so applicable to the way modern capitalist society chews up and spits out working class people in the pursuit of profit.</p>

<p>We’ve got strikes everywhere this week. First we start by checking in with Trader Joe’s, where the company recently closed a store in NYC to kill a union drive. Next we discuss the recommendations from Biden’s Presidential Emergency Board, which fail to resolve any of the major problems faced by rail workers. For our Amazon roundup this week, workers in San BernaRdino staged a walkout at one of the company’s Air Hubs last week, workers in Albany officially filed for an NLRB election, and TikTok creators form a pledge to support ALU demands. In Northern California, 2000 mental health workers with Kaiser Permanente are on strike to force the company to actually hire enough staff to provide patients the resources they need. Columbus teachers hit the picket lines on Monday for the first time in nearly 50 years, fighting for smaller class sizes, safe ventilation, and music and PE classes for all students. Workers at the biggest container port in the UK, Felixstowe, are on a weeklong strike to protest the port operator’s refusal to pay them a wage that keeps up with inflation. Finally, the Starbucks Workers United movement got a huge win this week when a judge ruled the company must rehire the Memphis 7.</p>

<p>On the second part of our series on the history of early US textile strikes, we move into the 20th century. As the textile industry expanded, advances in technology did not come with advances in safety. The drive for maximum profit led to one of the worst industrial disasters in US history, the Triangle Shirtwaist fire of 1911.  Just a year later, not far from where the Lowell Mill Girls formed one of the first labor unions in the country, workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts waged a massive strike for fair wages and safer conditions that would come to be known as the Bread and Roses strike. The workers, led by socialists and organizers from the IWW, fought to overcome the efforts of bosses to split workers up along ethnic lines. Finally, in 1934 as the textile industry moved out of New England and into the South in search of cheaper labor, one of the largest labor uprisings in US history erupted into a national textile strike all along the east coast. These struggles show many of the core contradictions of capitalism, and can teach us many valuable lessons for our organizing today.</p>

This week’s episode is kind of an angry one. We start out with some good news, as the ATU in DC have won their strike, and workers at Intelligentsia Coffee in Chicago have won their union vote. Trader Joe’s workers in Minneapolis won their union election in a landslide, potentially setting up a new nationwide union push. We also follow up with the workers at Heine Brothers coffee, where union busting efforts by management have escalated. We discuss the many (600,000+) crimes of Chipotle, which recently settled a massive lawsuit from NYC with a minor fine. Working conditions at Amazon continue to maim and kill workers, we discuss more deaths in New Jersey, unsafe temps in Memphis, and backbreaking labor in Albany. A new report was recently issued showing that unions have far more cash, and far fewer organizers, than business unionist leadership would like us to believe. Also this week, “detainees” have been on strike for months at two of the US migrant concentration camps, refusing to work for slave wages of $1/day in unsafe conditions. Finally, we close out looking at the weekly developments with Starbucks Workers United.

This week’s episode is kind of an angry one. We start out with some good news, as the ATU in DC have won their strike, and workers at Intelligentsia Coffee in Chicago have won their union vote. Trader Joe’s workers in Minneapolis won their union election in a landslide, potentially setting up a new nationwide union push. We also follow up with the workers at Heine Brothers coffee, where union busting efforts by management have escalated. We discuss the many (600,000+) crimes of Chipotle, which recently settled a massive lawsuit from NYC with a minor fine. Working conditions at Amazon continue to maim and kill workers, we discuss more deaths in New Jersey, unsafe temps in Memphis, and backbreaking labor in Albany. A new report was recently issued showing that unions have far more cash, and far fewer organizers, than business unionist leadership would like us to believe. Also this week, “detainees” have been on strike for months at two of the US migrant concentration camps, refusing to work for slave wages of $1/day in unsafe conditions. Finally, we close out looking at the weekly developments with Starbucks Workers United.

<p>The development of the industrial revolution in the United States begins with the textile industry. Centered in New England, the explosion of wealth from industrial manufacturing of cloth would form the foundation for the construction of the rest of the US industrial base. Along with that early capitalist development came the rise of the labor movement. In this two part series, we will discuss some of the earliest factory strikes in US history, and how they show in microcosm the development of the forms of capitalist oppression we still see today. We will discuss how class exploitation has always been bound up with oppression based on gender, race, age, and any other ways the capitalists could find to divide workers against each other. In the first episode we cover the very first factory strike in US history, at the Slater Mill in Pawtucket, RI, as well as the rise of the Lowell Mill Girls Association in Massachusetts. In the second episode, we will move into the 20th century, discussing the Triangle Shirtwaist fire and the national textile strike of 1934.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>We start this week’s episode with a quick follow up with the Indiana grad student workers who have won major gains despite the university’s continued refusal to recognize their union. Boston teachers have used rank and file methods to win a historic new contract that will help address homelessness in the city. The NLRB has signed onto an order demanding UMWA workers cover the costs of their more than a year long strike against Warrior Met coal, but they are fighting back. The Democrats introduced a bill in Congress with bipartisan support to permanently misclassify gig workers, which would destroy existing labor law. The DOJ has sued the poultry monopolies for wage fixing, but the proposed settlement doesn’t do much to help workers’ wages or job conditions. PetSmart, the nation’s biggest pet supply store, is being sued for trapping employees with thousands of dollars in debt for “grooming academy” training. 200 DC area transit workers are on strike, and could even potentially force out the private company managing what otherwise would be a public service. Finally we check in with the Starbucks Workers United movement, where the company continues to find new, creative ways to illegally retaliate against their own workers for unionizing.</p>

<p>On the first two parts of this series, we discussed what exactly rank and file organizing is, and how it differs from top down, business unionist organizing methods, and then discussed some historical examples. In this third part of the series, we do a deep dive on two major rank and file movements from the last decade. First we look at the Chicago Teachers Union and the rise of the rank and file caucus, CORE, to leadership over the massive 2012 teachers’ strike. Then we discuss one of the most recent major union drives from the IWW, the Burgerville Workers Union. Both of these drives show the power unions can have when they actually engage and empower the workers themselves to take the reins of their organization and fight for the issues that matter most to them.  These, along with the other examples we’ve covered, make a strong case for major unions to embrace rank and file leadership of union drives if they want to rebuild the labor movement.</p>

<p>This week on Work Stoppage, we start with a couple big union election victories. First, Hudson Workers United finally has their union election win recognized after a year-long ordeal. Then, workers at Trader Joe’s in Hadley, MA won their election to form the first recognized union at the chain. We also check in on the national strike in Panama, where workers have won two of their key demands to relieve the cost of living crisis. In recent weeks, lawmakers in Ukraine have moved to slash worker protections in the country, using the war as justification for dismantling the country’s labor code. More news came out this week about the worker who died at a New Jersey Amazon warehouse during Prime Week, and Amazon’s union busting has increased in Albany as the ALU moves towards filing for an election there. Also in Albany, a new union at Activision was announced recently, with game testers at Blizzard Albany filing for representation with the CWA. This past week was the first UAW convention since the one member, one vote reform campaign, and we discuss several of the measures passed in the run up to this fall’s elections. Finally, as always, we close out checking in on the Starbucks Workers United campaign, which continues to win over 80% of their elections.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In order to let as many folks as possible hear from the CAUSE workers fighting for a union at Amazon, we've decided to unlock our full interview with them!  We hope you enjoy the interview, and if you like the show please support us at patreon.com/workstoppage.</p>
<p>Original Description:
We were honored this week to be joined by Lance, an organizer with Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, CAUSE.  CAUSE has been working to organize workers at Amazon’s RDU1 warehouse in Garner, North Carolina, just outside Raleigh, since the beginning of this year. We discuss the challenges and successes they’ve had building power with their coworkers, what tactics they’ve found effective, and which ones less so. We discuss how soaring inflation has blunted Amazon’s argument that they pay a good wage, and how other folks thinking about organizing their workplace can get started.  Finally, we discuss how folks can support CAUSE in their fight to organize at Amazon.</p>

Lina’s back and we had so much labor news this week it was hard to squeeze it all in one episode. We start with several quick follow-ups. 400 Planned Parenthood workers in the upper Midwest won their union election in a landslide this week, as did the workers at America’s Test Kitchen. Workers at Activision walked out across the country this week in protest, and Medieval Times’ union movement has spread to a second castle. Also this week, Chipotle went full scorched earth and closed the store in Augusta, Maine who had been fighting to unionize. Amy’s Kitchen did something similar, closing a plant in San Jose where workers were unionizing even though the plant had been open for less than a year. A shocking story came out last week about the use of child labor at a Hyundai plant in Alabama. The recent upsurge in labor militancy in the UK spread to the Royal Mail this week, as 115,000 postal workers voted to authorize a potential strike. Also in Europe, Italy’s repression of militant trade unions escalated yet again this week, as several organizers from two militant unions were arrested for organizing strikes in the logistics sector. Finally, we close out checking in on the Starbucks Workers United movement, which has now unionized over 200 locations across the country!

We start out with the Medieval Times workers in New Jersey who have won their union…and immediately got threats from the company to not bargain in good faith.  Next we discuss the Verizon Retail union movement expanding to stores in Portland and Flint, Michigan. We have yet another case of a “progressive” coffee chain trying to stop its workers from unionizing, this time Heine Brothers in Louisville, Kentucky.  We also discuss the state of the struggle by railway workers to be able to strike for better working conditions, as once against the government has intervened using the Railway Labor Act.  Workers at the Guttmacher Institute won their union nearly unanimously this week, but faced immediate retaliation. Guides at Yellowstone National Park have been fighting for a union in the face of vicious repression by the private contractor who employs them and uses the park as a 21st century company town.  Finally, we do our weekly update on the Starbucks Workers United movement, where repression continues to escalate, but so do the ways workers are fighting back.</p>

We hope you enjoy, and if you like the show, please consider supporting us at patreon.com/workstoppage 

Original Description: </p>
<p>We were very lucky to be joined this week by Matt, a worker-organizer at Amazon’s SDF1 facility in Campbellsville, Kentucky working to organize his facility with the ALU.  Matt explains the challenges of organizing in a rural area where Amazon more or less runs like a company town. We discuss the differences in worker consciousness you encounter when working to organize at Amazon, the different tactics that they’ve used, and how they’ve worked to explain the importance of unions in fighting against exploitation. We also discuss the ways that Amazon has retaliated against Matt and other organizers for their work, including calling the local sheriff on organizers.</p>
<p>We encourage our listeners to donate to the SDF1 organizing committee’s solidarity fund: <a href='https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/fundraising/b524f63e-8261-41dc-b593-b775eb35c3f3'>https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/fundraising/b524f63e-8261-41dc-b593-b775eb35c3f3</a>

We discuss the differences in worker consciousness you encounter when working to organize at Amazon, the different tactics that they’ve used, and how they’ve worked to explain the importance of unions in fighting against exploitation. We also discuss the ways that Amazon has retaliated against Matt and other organizers for their work, including calling the local sheriff on organizers.</p>
<p>We encourage our listeners to donate to the SDF1 organizing committee’s solidarity fund: <a href='https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/fundraising/b524f63e-8261-41dc-b593-b775eb35c3f3'>https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/fundraising/b524f63e-8261-41dc-b593-b775eb35c3f3</a>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Workers are flexing their power all over, and we start this week with a quick update on the situation in Sri Lanka, where the people have had enough and stormed the presidential palace this weekend, chasing the government from power. Next we have a check-in on the Planned Parenthood workers in Massachusetts, who have voted nearly unanimously to join the SEIU this week. Also this week, the ABK Workers Alliance is planning a major walkout to fight gender inequity at Activision. In Mexico, the independent union movement continues to spread and help empower workers, now moving to the agricultural sector. We had another major national strike in Latin America this week, this time in Panama, where like so many other places workers are demanding something be done to address the inflation and cost of living crisis. Back in the US, workers at REI in Berkeley, California have joined the union wave. The ALU has expanded its efforts to unionize Amazon to multiple other organizing drives this week, including one just outside of Albany. Finally, we close with our weekly Starbucks update as the union movement nears 200 stores.</p>

Then we discuss the end (for now) of the national strike in Ecuador, what was won, and where it goes from here. Next we check in on the Case New Holland strike, which is going international as UK Case workers have also gone on strike.  Also this week, knights, squires, and falcon-handlers are organizing into a guild at Medieval Times to fight for safer, fairer work conditions.  Airlines took massive bailouts early in the pandemic, then slashed staff and lobbied against covid protections, and now the whole air travel system in this country is messed up.  Workers installing solar fields are doing incredibly important work towards a renewable energy future in the US, but face some of the most atrocious work conditions in the country due to the temporary, contract nature of the work. Finally, as usual, we check in on the Starbucks Workers United campaign, where the company’s illegal retaliation continues, but the union has grown to over 5000 workers strong.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>We start this week’s episode with a discussion of how unions can play a major role in fighting for workers’ right to reproductive healthcare in the wake of the Supreme Court gutting abortion rights. Then we start the episode proper with a follow-up with the Indiana University grad workers, where despite winning overwhelming support from faculty, the administration is digging in and refusing to recognize the union. Then we have some on the ground labor reporting from Dan, who discusses a local strike of Teamsters at DHL in Pawtucket, RI, where workers are fighting for healthcare and a living wage. Next, over 4000 workers in one of the largest platinum mines in the world in South Africa have gone on strike to protest horrible wages paid to contract workers.  Also this week, workers in Maine filed for the first union in the country at a Chipotle and are fighting against understaffing and overwork leading to unsanitary conditions. Train drivers in New Jersey delivered a master class in a well-timed industrial action when they staged a sickout the Friday evening of Juneteenth weekend in protest of not receiving holiday pay. The big story this week is obviously the massive rail strike in England, where 40,000 workers shut down the rails for three days to protest the government’s plan to slash thousands of jobs, destroy pensions, and enforce a pay cut during record inflation. Finally, as usual, we close with our update on the Starbucks Workers United movement as it continues to rack up wins.</p>

<p>On June 2, Microsoft announced that it planned to shift its position on how it relates to unions, rather than pursuing scorched earth union busting campaigns like Amazon and Starbucks, it would embrace “neutrality”.  While it’s possible this is just cover to try and smooth the approval of Microsoft’s $70B acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it presents some big questions for unionists.  We know our interests are directly opposed to the bosses, and they will never tolerate militant unions that fight for what the workers deserve, so how should we approach this sort of “neutrality”? We decided this was a topic a bit too long winded to squeeze into the middle of a regular episode, and so this Shop Floor Discussion is dedicated to trying to hammer out how unions should react to these sorts of “olive branches” from companies.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Filled with renewed energy from watching some of the amazing panels and speeches at this weekend’s Labor Notes conference, it’s another episode of Work Stoppage.  We start with several follow-ups, first in South Korea, where truckers won their strike and secured an agreement to extend minimum wage protections. Also this week, XPO Logistics truckers at the Port of Los Angeles finally won their NLRB hearing and have been reclassified employees rather than independent contractors and will now have a union election. The Massachusetts Supreme Court struck down a proposed Prop 22 clone this week, in a good move for gig workers in the state. In big news this week, we finally have our first unionized Apple store, as the workers of Towson, Maryland won their election by a 2:1 margin to organize with the Machinists.  Retaliation against ALU organizers continued this week with yet another being fired, the same week as the hearing to determine whether the JFK8 election will be upheld got underway in Arizona. 1450 researchers at the University of Washington voted overwhelmingly to unionize with the UAW after the University refused voluntary recognition last December.  For our big story this week, a massive national strike has been underway in Ecuador as Indigenous groups are leading huge swaths of the working class in protest of the right wing government. Finally, as usually, we close out with a look at the many Starbucks wins this week, even as the company continues its failing scorched earth campaign of union busting. </p>

<p>As we discussed in our first episode of this series, there’s a long, sordid history of collaboration between the upper leadership of the AFL-CIO and the US National Security State, specifically the CIA.  Over several decades during the Cold War, through the American Institution for Free Labor Development (AIFLD), the CIA used US labor to infiltrate, subvert, and destroy independent labor movements in numerous countries around the world. We continue the discussion of that history in this episode, largely drawn from the new book El Golpe: US Labor, The CIA, and The Coup at Ford in Mexico by Rob McKenzie.  The collusion between the AFL-CIO and the CIA continued all the way up through the 90s, and in this episode we cover how that relationship led to the involvement of the CIA in violently crushing a nascent rank and file labor movement at Ford in Mexico in 1990.  The history of this collaboration is dark, but understanding it is vital to building a revived, transparent, worker-led labor movement in this country that will learn from the class collaborationist mistakes of the past.</p>

We also follow up on the Case New Holland strike where 2000 UAW workers remain on strike as the company refuses to bring a fair offer to the table.  Amazon has continued their campaign of harassment of organizers, and new documents released this week show the details behind how they discipline workers. There’s also a new independent union drive at Amazon, this one in North Carolina, that deserves all our support. Also this week, Seattle passed a first of its kind minimum wage law for gig workers to prevent companies from evading labor regulations.  We may be on the verge of the biggest national rail strike in England in nearly a century, with 40,000 workers voting to authorize a strike in the coming weeks. Workers at Moog in North Carolina are unionizing with the IBEW due to the company paying poverty wages while workers assemble synthesizers that cost more than they make in a month.  Finally, we catch up on the Starbucks Workers United movement, which has just set up a $1 million strike fund to help workers fight the company’s vicious union busting campaign.</p>

There’s also a new independent union drive at Amazon, this one in North Carolina, that deserves all our support. Also this week, Seattle passed a first of its kind minimum wage law for gig workers to prevent companies from evading labor regulations.  We may be on the verge of the biggest national rail strike in England in nearly a century, with 40,000 workers voting to authorize a strike in the coming weeks. Workers at Moog in North Carolina are unionizing with the IBEW due to the company paying poverty wages while workers assemble synthesizers that cost more than they make in a month.  Finally, we catch up on the Starbucks Workers United movement, which has just set up a $1 million strike fund to help workers fight the company’s vicious union busting campaign.</p>

Unfortunately, we’ve got a few setbacks to start the episode this week. First, we follow up with the USW workers at Chevron’s refinery in Richmond, CA, where workers have narrowly approved a new contract that doesn’t meet the main goals their two month long strike set out for. Next, we talk about workers at the unionizing Apple store in Atlanta being forced to withdraw their election petition due to union busting. Also this week, workers at Great Lakes Coffee in Detroit have been on strike for recognition of their union for three months, and rather than recognize it and reopen a profitable location, the owners decided to close the store. Workers with Amazonians United held a walkout this past week in Chicago to demand the reinstatement of a recently fired Black worker who had faced racial discrimination on the job. 600 Planned Parenthood workers in six states have filed to unionize with the SEIU, and hopefully we don’t see a repeat of the organizations 2017-18 union busting. Workers at America’s Test Kitchen in Boston are unionizing because for many, they spend all day making recipes they could never afford to eat. Finally, we close out with our Starbucks Workers United update, as many workers struck or walked out over Memorial Day weekend, and the movement crossed the 100 union store threshold.

<p>On the first episode of the series, we talked about the reasons why rank and file unionism, running your union in a democratic fashion, is so important to rebuilding the labor movement.  On our second episode, we dig into a few historical examples of rank and file organizing which demonstrate the power of these organizing methods.  First, we start out by discussing the history of the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers, the UE.  The UE was started back in the 30s as a democratic union, and despite facing fierce attacks from business unionists and the US state, they have stayed true to their organizing methods for over 80 years.  Then, we discuss the history of the One Member, One Vote campaign, which was the result of decades of struggle for more democracy within the UAW.  Finally, we discuss a couple other real world examples of how rank and file methods can build real power on the jobsite and sum up with how these methods can be the foundation for a revival of the US labor movement as a base for a class conscious movement.  In the final part of the series, we will discuss a few more major examples of rank and file organizing from the Chicago Teachers Union and the Industrial Workers of the World.</p>

We also cover the union busting campaign at Apple retail stores where workers are organizing with the CWA.  Workers at a Refresco bottling plant in New Jersey have had to win TWO union elections to get their union with the UE recognized due to a insane legal technicality, but now hope their determination will inspire others.  30,000 workers in South Africa’s gold mines have been on strike for three months as the company refuses to budge on a raise of $63 a year.  As the war in Ukraine continues, companies and politicians in the country have used it as an opportunity to strip workers of many of their labor rights, while putting no controls on capitalists reaping superprofits from the increased exploitation.  Finally, we wrap up with our weekly update on the many actions and union elections in the Starbucks Workers United movement.</p>

We’ve tried to cover all the news coming in from the Starbucks Workers United movement on the regular show every week, but this week there was just so much news we had to give it its own episode. We start out covering Howard Schultz committing a ULP on an earnings call by threatening to withhold benefits from unionizing employees. We also cover a recent study showing just how much extra profit Starbucks has raked in during the pandemic, and how little has made it to workers. The NLRB finally responded to Starbucks’ massive illegal union busting campaign this week, filing a flurry of complaints against the company for violations of the NLRA. These suits demand the rehiring of several of the worker organizers that Starbucks has fired in retaliation for unionizing, as well as changes to captive audience meetings and even changes to the Starbucks employee handbook. In weirder news, Oscar nominated actor James Cromwell glued himself to a counter at an NYC Starbucks as part of a PETA protest. Finally, we wrap up with a roundup of the results of the 14 union elections since our last episode.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>There’s so much to cover this week we had to pull Starbucks out for its own episode, watch for that in the patron feed later this week. We start by following up with the striking Chevron workers in Richmond, CA, where the oil conglomerate has hired local cops to act as strikebreakers. After a few more quick-hit follow up stories, we discuss a strike at Case New Holland in Wisconsin and Iowa, where 1000 members of the UAW have hit the picket lines to fight a two tier system. In Amazon news this week, the company’s newly announced abortion benefit leaves out the workers who need it most, the NLRB files a massive complaint arguing captive audience meetings are illegal, and Chris Smalls testifies on Capitol Hill. Boston teachers have been fighting for a new contract for months and have turned to creative tactics since they are banned from striking. The Connecticut state legislature banned companies from holding captive audience meetings in the state this week, and bus drivers in DC won major wage gains after just 3 days on strike. </p>

<p>We’ve talked about the importance of unions being organized and run in a “rank-and-file” manner a million times on the show, but we hadn’t really had a good opportunity to sit down and layout exactly what that means.  On this episode, we discuss what exactly rank-and-file unionism is, what it is not, and why it’s so vital if we want to build effective organizations that will fight for the working class.  We go through counter examples of Consumer Co-ops, ESOPs, and the methodology used for many bureaucratically run unions here in the US, Business Unionism.  We finish off by discussing a short guide to rank-and-file organizing used by communists during the Depression, Organizing Methods in the Steel Industry by William Z Foster, and how that methodology is still relevant today.  On part two of this series, we will discuss several examples of rank and file unionism in practice in more detail.</p>

<p>On April 1, the Amazon Labor Union won one of the most historic labor victories in the US in decades.  Despite the enormous difference in resources, the ALU was able to defeat one of the richest, most anti-union corporations in the world.  This is such a momentous development, we thought it would be important to try and learn as much as possible from their incredible work.  So in this Shop Floor Discussion, we discuss the ways that the ALU’s campaign differed from traditional union organizing campaigns.  We go over their commitment to worker-led, rank-and-file organizing, the way they embraced the diversity of the JFK8 workforce and made it a strength, how they used every tactic possible to get their messaging out, and how their adaptability and willingness to go beyond the scope of traditional tactics helped them succeed. While there’s no single blueprint that can be copied from one workplace to another, there’s a lot that the ALU’s success can teach us about how to successfully organizing in today’s harsh labor environment.  If we want to revive the US labor movement, we would be wise to learn from this amazing upset.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>We start this week’s episode following up with Verizon workers, where the company seems to be taking a page from Starbucks’ union busting as they have illegally fired a worker at a store in Washington for organizing.  Then we catch up with the striking Finnish healthcare workers, who have ended their strike and are threatening mass resignations in response to threats from the government to make healthcare worker strikes illegal.  Also in healthcare, workers staged 24 hour strikes at a nursing home in Saugus, Massachusetts and at healthcare facilities across Northern California last week decrying low wages and unsafe staffing levels.  The ALU held a major rally this weekend to bring out support for the workers at the LDJ5 sorting facility who will vote on whether to unionize this week.  Teachers in Richmond, Virginia have voted overwhelmingly to unionize for the first time in over 40 years, after a change in law allowing collective bargaining for public workers.  University of Chicago Illinois grad students went on strike for the past week to protest poverty wages and lack of protections against discrimination and sexual misconduct.  Finally, another week, another huge slate of wins for the Starbucks Workers United movement.  This week saw 8 more locations unionized, including the Seattle Roastery, a huge hub just 2.5 miles from Starbucks corporate HQ.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>We start this week following up on the effort to unionize in immigration law by the brave organizers of Hudson Workers United, whose fight has now dragged on for over a year.  Next we check in with the ALU, where the focus has turned to the LDJ5 sorting center’s upcoming election, and Amazon has cranked up the union busting.  In our weekly look at the Starbucks Workers United movement, we discuss strikes protesting the company’s retaliation against its employees in North Carolina and Seattle.  Meanwhile, the union is 7-1 in NLRB elections over the last week.  Indiana grad student workers have gone on strike to demand recognition of their union, and have seen solidarity from undergrads and faculty.  Theater is not an industry we have covered much, but there have been a few signs that the surge in labor organizing may be spreading there as well.  Finally, workers have won union recognition at two Verizon retail stores in Washington, and we discuss the potential impact of the energy from Amazon and Starbucks workers spreading to retail.

Next we discuss the end of the striking IBEW workers at WTTW, where the three week strike seems to have ended largely in defeat with a concession filled contract.  25,000 healthcare workers in Finland are on strike, demanding fair wages and an end to short staffing.  We cover the police raid on the headquarters of the Unione Sindacale di Base in Italy after they have led several anti-imperialist protests. Then we discuss the potential move by the NLRB to ban captive audience meetings and what the general outlook of the labor movement should be to NLRB rulings.  We had another major victory for organizing in higher education this week, as 4000 MIT graduate students voted to unionize with the UE.  Finally, we do our weekly check-in with Starbucks Workers United, where workers have won an incredible nine more union elections over the past week, bringing their total to 18 recognized union stores.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>We start this week’s episode of Work Stoppage checking in on the fallout from P&O Ferries illegally laying off their entire workforce without warning.  Three weeks later and their fleet is still out of service, leading to massive shipping and travel delays in the UK. Next we discuss the end of the striking IBEW workers at WTTW, where the three week strike seems to have ended largely in defeat with a concession filled contract.  25,000 healthcare workers in Finland are on strike, demanding fair wages and an end to short staffing.  We cover the police raid on the headquarters of the Unione Sindacale di Base in Italy after they have led several anti-imperialist protests. Then we discuss the potential move by the NLRB to ban captive audience meetings and what the general outlook of the labor movement should be to NLRB rulings.  We had another major victory for organizing in higher education this week, as 4000 MIT graduate students voted to unionize with the UE.  Finally, we do our weekly check-in with Starbucks Workers United, where workers have won an incredible nine more union elections over the past week, bringing their total to 18 recognized union stores.</p>

First, we follow up with the Minneapolis educators, who have agreed to a new contract, ending their three week strike. Next we do our weekly Starbucks roundup, discussing union busting in Boston and union victories in Mesa, AZ, Seattle, and Knoxville, TN. Another major teachers strike is on, this one in Sacramento, where low wages and awful working conditions low has led to a crisis of short staffing. IBEW technicians have been on strike for a couple weeks now at Chicago’s PBS affiliate, WTTW, where the union is fighting to protect union work from being farmed out to contractors. Finally, we finish up covering the colossal two day general strike in India, where as many as 200 million workers have shut the country down to protest the anti-worker policies of the Modi government.

<p>In the second part of our series on the decline of the US labor movement, we discuss the impact of business unionism in the 1970s and the 1980s.  We dispel the commonly promoted image that Jimmy Carter was a friend of the working class, and cover some of the many anti-labor actions taken by his administration.  We cover the Reagan years, the PATCO strike, and the rise of Neoliberalism.  Finally we go over the development and spread of Lean Manufacturing and Just-In-Time Logistics, and how those methods of management have come to shape today's labor environment.  Throughout, we show how the class collaborationist ideology of business unionism left the major US labor unions totally unprepared to deal with the assault by business in the 70s and 80s.  In our last episode of the series, we will discuss some of the more recent developments in the 90s and 2000s, some myths and realities of our current labor climate, and what we need to change to rebuild a strong labor movement in the US.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>After some discussion about the transition to new leadership at the Teamsters, our first story on this week’s episode of Work Stoppage covers the recent walkouts at 3 Amazon facilities carried out by Amazonians United.  Then we hit the weekly quota of Starbucks coverage discussing the return of Howard Schultz as CEO, the refusal of the company to stop its aggressive union busting campaign, and a strike by Starbucks workers in Kansas City.  Next we discuss an awful story out of the UK, where 800 workers at one of the country’s largest ferry companies, P&O Ferries, were summarily fired by a 3 minute zoom recording with no prior warning.  Also this week, 500 workers at the Richmond oil refinery in the Bay Area have gone on strike over wages not covering soaring costs of living.  Airport workers in Italy refused to continue work this week after discovering that so called “humanitarian aid” they were loading onto a transport plane was in fact weapons being sent by NATO, prompting protests from the workers and their union.  Finally, teachers and education workers in San Francisco staged a 3 day sit in at the headquarters of the Unified School District to protest unpaid wages during a payroll system changeover.</p>

                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After some discussion about the transition to new leadership at the Teamsters, our first story on this week’s episode of Work Stoppage covers the recent walkouts at 3 Amazon facilities carried out by Amazonians United.  Then we hit the weekly quota of Starbucks coverage discussing the return of Howard Schultz as CEO, the refusal of the company to stop its aggressive union busting campaign, and a strike by Starbucks workers in Kansas City.  Next we discuss an awful story out of the UK, where 800 workers at one of the country’s largest ferry companies, P&O Ferries, were summarily fired by a 3 minute zoom recording with no prior warning.  Also this week, 500 workers at the Richmond oil refinery in the Bay Area have gone on strike over wages not covering soaring costs of living.  Airport workers in Italy refused to continue work this week after discovering that so called “humanitarian aid” they were loading onto a transport plane was in fact weapons being sent by NATO, prompting protests from the workers and their union.  Finally, teachers and education workers in San Francisco staged a 3 day sit in at the headquarters of the Unified School District to protest unpaid wages during a payroll system changeover.</p>

<p>In the first episode of a new series, we dig into the primary causes of the ongoing decline of union membership in the US, especially in private industry.  While there are certainly spots of hope in movements like Starbucks Workers United and other grassroots union organizing drives, US labor union density has continued its long 40 year decline.  If we want to rebuild the US labor movement as a fighting movement of the working class, we must understand the root causes of the precarious situation we are in today.  In this episode, we look at some of the foundational issues behind the problems of the US labor movement, like the class collaborationist approach of “business unionism”, the refusal of major unions to address “controversial issues” like racism, sexism, and other forms of oppression, and an abandonment of the struggle for control of the shop floor.  In future episodes, we will look at some of the key moments in the failures of business unionism from the height of raw union membership numbers in the 70s, through the losses of the Reagan era, to the long steady retreats of the Neoliberal 90s to today.</p>

<p>We’ve talked about the violence facing labor organizers, human rights defenders, and Indigenous leaders in Colombia on the show before, in the context of last year’s working class uprising.  But we hadn’t really had a chance to give the topic the amount of time it deserves.  Colombia is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a labor organizer, with hundreds killed in the last few years.  The US neocolonial control of Colombia’s government and economy is largely to blame, as major US corporations like Nestle and Coca-Cola have taken advantage of the Colombian state’s complicity with paramilitary death squads to quash organizing drives at their facilities.  On this Shop Floor Discussion, we get into the history of state/para-state violence in Colombia, the difficulties that presents for labor organizing, and some of the connections to Operation Condor.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a busy week in Labor news so we’ve got a jam packed episode of Work Stoppage.  First, we’ve got a few recent victories:  Workers at Coffee Tree Roasters in Pittsburgh won their union election 17-3 and will now be represented by UFCW Local 1776.  Workers at Rich Products’ Jon Donaire ice cream cake plant have ended their four month long strike with three times the wage increase that the company initially offered.  Also, following up our story about gig workers in Canada, Ontario’s labor ministry has ruled that Ontario Uber drivers are in fact employees and gig companies must immediately act to comply with provincial labor law.  In that vein, we also report on a bill in Washington state currently supported by both gig companies and Uber that would permanently misclassify gig workers in exchange for some mild benefits.  Amazon has once again stepped up their repression, having the NYPD arrest several organizers with the Amazon Labor Union, including Christian Smalls, for “trespassing.”  We also discuss the awful working conditions at the Hershey’s candy factory in Stuarts Draft, Virginia, where over 1300 workers are voting on whether to unionize with the BCTGM.  Finally this week, Starbucks workers got another major victory as the workers at a Mesa, Arizona location finally got their ballots counted and won the third successful Starbucks union election.</p>

Next we cover strikes by healthcare workers in Sri Lanka and Nigeria, where workers have faced salary cuts, unpaid wages, and insufficient PPE.  Since going on strike, both countries’ governments have threatened the striking workers with legal reprisals. Also this week we discuss Amazon’s attempts to hide their covid numbers and how workers at facilities in California have helped expose them.  We also cover a new report documenting rampant wage theft and abuse in the temp worker industry, which is ripe for unionization.  Finally, we’ve got the first of what will hopefully be many union victories at PetSmart, as the workers in Toronto have won their union election to become the first unionized PetSmart of their over 1700 stores across North America.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Since we've just finished a new patrons-only series on the nature of the state, this time focusing on the repressive state apparatus, we figured it would be a good idea to make the first part of our series on the theory of how the state functions available to all our listeners. This episode gives a window into what we have been going over on the Overtime episodes.  </p>

Original Description: On this Overtime episode, the first in a series, John, Lina, and Dan take some time to dig into the fundamentals behind our understandings of the nature of the state: what it is, its historical development, how it functions, and how it can be changed. During this first part of our discussion, Dan takes us through the theoretical work and historical analysis on the state by Marx, Engels, and Lenin, how they defined the state, how they foresaw it being abolished in the future, and how we could get from where we are under the domination of the capitalist ruling class, to a real democracy where workers would have state power instead of a tiny rich ruling class. We talk about how their theories apply today, how we see their historical materialist analysis reflected in the US state today, and why their theories remain vital for workers struggles for control of their own lives.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we begin following up with our friends at Student Workers of Columbia who have finally ratified their first contract after a years’ long struggle for recognition.  Next we discuss the recent developments in the healthcare industry where several companies are attempting to apply the gig model to nursing.  Issues have been brewing in the rail industry for years as companies have slashed workforces to raise profits, and recently 17,000 workers voted to authorize a strike after BNSF unilaterally imposed a draconian attendance policy, but the workers have been blocked from striking by the courts.  We check in on the union drive in Bessemer where ballots for the re-do election go out this week and Amazon’s union busting continues unabated.  Amazon workers are also organizing in NYC, where Amazon Labor Union has re-filed for election at the JFK8 warehouse as the NLRB alleges Amazon’s union busting has broken the law.  Finally, workers have filed for the first union election at REI in Manhattan, as yet another “progressive, liberal company” shows its true colors in refusing voluntary recognition. </p>

In the final episode of our series on the history of the US repressive state apparatus, we discuss some of its major developments on the homefront during the last 20 years. We cover the massive rise in state surveillance and attacks on the Muslim community in the wake of 9/11. Also the rise of intelligence sharing “Fusion Centers”, pulled straight from the CIA’s coordinating role in Operation Condor. We go over the creation and massive expansion of ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, the vicious repression of Indigenous land and water defenders protesting DAPL, Line 3, and other pipelines, and the string of suspicious deaths of leaders of the uprising in Ferguson. Finally, we close out the series summing up the lessons we can apply in our organizing today from this history, and what inspiration we can draw from the movements that have resisted the repressive apparatus over the last century.

Next we check in with the Game Workers Alliance drive at Activision Blizzard King, where Raven Software QA workers have officially filed for union recognition with the NLRB. Also this week, truck drivers at the Port of Los Angeles are fighting their misclassification as independent contractors and hoping to start a movement to re-unionize the entire sector. We discuss a recent investigation by Business Insider that exposed thousands of arbitration settlements for horrific treatment of store managers and employees at Family Dollar. We move to Karnataka, India, where a report from the Workers’ Rights Consortium has revealed tens of millions of dollars in wage theft propping up massive profits in the fast fashion industry. Finally, there’s an actual general strike going on in the concrete industry in Seattle, where the local construction industry has ground to a halt after a consortium of concrete firms refuse to bargain with local Teamsters.

<p>On the third part of our Overtime series on the history of the US repressive state apparatus, we dive into the long relationship between the CIA and the global drug trade.  From working with the Mafia to break strikes in post-war Europe and protecting their heroin smuggling, to helping the Kuomintang fight China in the 50s funded by opium traffic, to funding a secret war in Laos on the back of the drug trade, the CIA has been involved in drugs since its inception.   Knowing how these operations worked greatly affects how we view the “War on Drugs” here in the US.  We also discuss Operation Cyclone, the US war against the socialist government of Afghanistan, using Mujahedin fighters armed, trained, and paid by the CIA.  Much of the propaganda around the "Brave Mujahedin Fighters of Afghanistan" is still reflected in how our media reports on CIA backed forces in "enemy" countries today.  Finally, we cover the last major foreign operation of the series, the US post-Cold War policy of instigating “Color Revolutions” in countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, to install neoliberal Western-friendly governments, and how these tactics and the use of NGOs are seen here in the US as well.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>We start this week’s episode following up with the Republic Services sanitation workers in San Diego, who have ended their month long strike and ratified a new contract.  We discuss the gains and the limitations of the new deal.  We also check in with the massively expanding Starbucks Workers United campaign, which has spread to 26 locations as of this writing and likely more once we release the episode.  For a look at how a more united labor movement is fighting for workers’ safety, we cover a massive teachers strike in France over insufficient covid response, and the actions the strike forced the government to take to meet teachers’ demands.  The entire US service sector gets screwed over with a lack of paid sick leave, but a new report shows how Red Lobster treats its workers particularly badly and forces a majority of them to work sick.  Finally, South Korean workers and farmers held a massive rally in Seoul this past Saturday to demand radical action by the government to solve the crisis of neoliberal austerity.</p>

<p>On the second part of our Overtime series on the history of the US repressive state apparatus, we discuss its extension to attack working class movements overseas in Operation Gladio and Operation Condor.  We discuss how in the aftermath of World War 2, the United States organized, armed, and trained fascist terrorist groups to act as “stay behind” armies, ostensibly in preparation for a Soviet invasion of Western Europe.  In reality, these groups were primarily used to target the domestic population of their countries and suppress any left wing or workers movement deemed too friendly to communism by the CIA.  We also discuss the extension of the CIA’s secret war against the working class to Latin America via the organization of a trans-national network of intelligence agencies connecting the fascist military dictatorships they brought to power.  We cover how these security agencies erased borders in their murderous quest to destroy any movement deemed “subversive” and a threat to United States interests. These massive secret operations left tens of thousands dead, and no one in the US has ever been held accountable for orchestrating them. We go over what lessons we can draw from the lengths the US national security state is willing to go to maintain its dominance over the world’s resources, and how these tactics have evolved into operations being carried out today.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s the first episode of Work Stoppage of 2022 and the state is once again throwing workers to the wolves.  We start with a follow up on the St Vincent nurses strike, where they’ve ratified a new contract to end one of the longest strikes in the country, but have faced a nefarious move by the company to try and spark a decertification vote.  Next we discuss a union drive recently launched by workers in Pittsburgh at Coffee Tree Roasters, where workers were immediately retaliated against by management.  Sanitation workers in San Diego have been on strike for 3 weeks for better wages, benefits and reasonable workloads, as their employer Republic Services have brought in scabs to break the strike.  Our main story this week is the US government’s policy of forcing workers to get sick and die in order to “keep the economy open.”  We discuss OSHA rescinding workplace safety protection rules for healthcare workers and the efforts by nurses to fight back.  We also cover the CDC’s absurd change in guidelines to allow companies to slash their sick time for workers who get covid and force them back to work after only 5 days.  Teachers are also fighting back, as the Chicago Teachers Union voted to switch to remote learning, only to have the city lock them out and try and pit parents against teachers to cover for the government’s failures.  In our final story this week, Indigenous groups, environmental activists, and labor unions united in Argentina last month to stand together to force the repeal of a neoliberal mining law that could have devastated the region, showing that mass struggle gets results.</p>

                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s the first episode of Work Stoppage of 2022 and the state is once again throwing workers to the wolves.  We start with a follow up on the St Vincent nurses strike, where they’ve ratified a new contract to end one of the longest strikes in the country, but have faced a nefarious move by the company to try and spark a decertification vote.  Next we discuss a union drive recently launched by workers in Pittsburgh at Coffee Tree Roasters, where workers were immediately retaliated against by management.  Sanitation workers in San Diego have been on strike for 3 weeks for better wages, benefits and reasonable workloads, as their employer Republic Services have brought in scabs to break the strike.  Our main story this week is the US government’s policy of forcing workers to get sick and die in order to “keep the economy open.”  We discuss OSHA rescinding workplace safety protection rules for healthcare workers and the efforts by nurses to fight back.  We also cover the CDC’s absurd change in guidelines to allow companies to slash their sick time for workers who get covid and force them back to work after only 5 days.  Teachers are also fighting back, as the Chicago Teachers Union voted to switch to remote learning, only to have the city lock them out and try and pit parents against teachers to cover for the government’s failures.  In our final story this week, Indigenous groups, environmental activists, and labor unions united in Argentina last month to stand together to force the repeal of a neoliberal mining law that could have devastated the region, showing that mass struggle gets results.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>For the last episode of Work Stoppage of 2021, we decided to take a look back at the stories and trends that we covered in the labor movement this year. We discuss the first major efforts at unionizing Amazon [7:00-24:11], the ways in which OSHA let workers down [24:12-35:19], and the many companies that put forward a "progressive" image only to use the same union busting tactics of every other company [35:20-51:35]. We also talk about the unfortunately large number of stories we covered this year on modern slavery [51:36-1:02:49], the year long struggle and triumph of the Indian Farmers Movement [1:02:50-1:15:51], and finally the fall upsurge in the labor movement here in the US during "Striketober" [1:15:52-1:25:30]. We try and draw what lessons we can take from these major trends labor took in 2021, and look ahead to what might be in store for 2022.</p>
<p>As always, thank you to all our listeners, we love doing the show and look forward to another year covering the labor movement!

<p>Join us down the rabbit hole on this first part of a series of patrons-only Overtime episodes where we discuss an overview of the history of the US repressive state apparatus, and how it has been used to crush working class movements.  In this episode we discuss the history of violent state suppression of strikes, and how the federal government worked hand in hand with private armed forces like the Pinkertons to infiltrate and crush early labor unions.  We talk about how repression of the movement changed with the legalization of collective bargaining and the ejection of communists from the major unions during the Red Scare.  We also get into some of the early covert programs developed to fight left-wing movements and Black liberation groups, COINTELPRO and Operation Mockingbird.  Future episodes will go over programs like Operation Gladio, Operation Condor, the CIA’s involvement in the drug trade, Operation Cyclone, and more in the long sordid history of US covert warfare.  All with the ultimate goal of understanding the repressive tactics used by the US against working class movements around the world, so we can understand how that affects our movement today.

(Note: I realized in the preview I said the Church Committee was 1965, it was actually 1975)</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>We start this week’s episode with a check in with Doughnut Workers United, who finally officially won their unfair labor practice charges against Voodoo Doughnuts for illegally firing workers protesting unsafe working conditions during this summer’s heat wave.  Next, we go over the end of the Kellogg’s strike, covering the new contract’s wins but also the notable fact that it doesn’t eliminate the two tiered employment system.  Also this week, the longest nursing strike in 15 years may be about to end, as workers at St. Vincent’s hospital have reached a tentative agreement to end their 9 month long strike.  We also discuss a whistleblower at Apple who was fired for inquiring into potentially unsafe working conditions, and exposed the company’s culture of extreme (and probably illegal) levels of secrecy.  Pharmacists are yet another profession facing proletarianization, as the industry has been consolidated among a few huge firms, leading to low wages and massive overwork due to understaffing, so some are fighting back and launching a walkout.  Finally, one of the least talked about areas of healthcare is long term home care, where workers face brutal conditions, leading to workers in NYC protesting loopholes in labor law allowing them to be forced  to work 24 hour shifts.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s a heavy start to this week’s episode, as we begin with the horrific aftermath of the multi-state tornado system that killed over 80 people, including at least 14 workers forced to stay at their jobs by their management.  These workers were murdered by their employers in the pursuit of profit, for which the companies are unlikely to ever be brought to justice.  We follow up that difficult segment with an update on the Kellogg’s strike, where workers overwhelmingly rejected a tentative agreement that would have maintained the two-tier contract system, standing strong to protect the rights of future workers.  Moving on to the first unambiguously happy story of the episode, Starbucks workers in Buffalo won their union elections at two of the three Buffalo stores that held votes last week, and have inspired union drives in at least 6 more stores.  Also this week, workers at Activision Blizzard King went on strike to protest the firing of testers at Raven Software and also announced their drive to form the first unionized workforce at a major game studio.  We also discuss the IATSE strike on the set of the film “Nefarious”, where the right wing production company used Oklahoma’s right to work law and free child labor from a local technical school to try and evade union protections.  Finally, we close on a high note, as the biggest new bargaining unit of the year was recognized as 17,000 student researchers finally had their branch of the UAW recognized by the University of California system.

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>It’s a heavy start to this week’s episode, as we begin with the horrific aftermath of the multi-state tornado system that killed over 80 people, including at least 14 workers forced to stay at their jobs by their management.  These workers were murdered by their employers in the pursuit of profit, for which the companies are unlikely to ever be brought to justice.  We follow up that difficult segment with an update on the Kellogg’s strike, where workers overwhelmingly rejected a tentative agreement that would have maintained the two-tier contract system, standing strong to protect the rights of future workers.  Moving on to the first unambiguously happy story of the episode, Starbucks workers in Buffalo won their union elections at two of the three Buffalo stores that held votes last week, and have inspired union drives in at least 6 more stores.  Also this week, workers at Activision Blizzard King went on strike to protest the firing of testers at Raven Software and also announced their drive to form the first unionized workforce at a major game studio.  We also discuss the IATSE strike on the set of the film “Nefarious”, where the right wing production company used Oklahoma’s right to work law and free child labor from a local technical school to try and evade union protections.  Finally, we close on a high note, as the biggest new bargaining unit of the year was recognized as 17,000 student researchers finally had their branch of the UAW recognized by the University of California system.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>On a very special interview episode of Work Stoppage, we were lucky enough to be joined by Charlie, a PhD student and organizer with Student Workers of Columbia, who are currently engaged in the largest strike in the country.  We discuss the history of student worker organizing at Columbia and the process students have been going through to try and get their first contract with the university.  We go over the conditions which led to the strike, from poverty wages in one of the most expensive cities in the world, to insufficient access to healthcare, dental care, childcare, and other issues.  Charlie explains some of the difficulties faced by the students, especially in the earlier strike this spring, of organizing during covid, but also how students and faculty have rallied around the striking student workers during the current strike.  Columbia has consistently refused to bargain in good faith with the workers, even going so far as to send an email to all students with veiled threats to fire workers who stay on strike.  We talk about how the community has responded to the strike, the student workers’ relationship with the broader labor movement including the UAW, and how our listeners can support the workers.</p>

John's back, Lina's away, and businesses keep oppressing their workers. We start this week's episode with an Amazon roundup, as the NLRB officially orders a new election in Bessemer, the NY AG demands Christian Smalls be reinstated, and independent researchers find Amazon concealed 20,000 workplace related COVID cases. Next we have a rare discussion of labor relations in the sports world, as the owners in Major League Baseball have locked out the players is a dispute over player salaries. The big labor news of the week was the membership of the UAW voting to switch election of their leadership from an undemocratic delegate system to a one member, one vote system, potentially setting the stage for a new rank and file upsurge at next years convention. Workers at a Rich Products' ice cream cake plant in Los Angeles have been on strike for a month, as their multibillion dollar parent company refuses to give the workers a measly $1/hr raise and more than 3 sick days a year. Finally, we discuss the recent story of hackers accessing receipt printers and making them print out an "Antiwork Manifesto".

We start with the Kellogg’s strike, where a new tentative agreement has been reached to potentially end the two month long strike. Next we discuss the international effort to reign in Amazon’s labor abuses with strikes around the world on Black Friday organized by the Make Amazon Pay coalition. Then we talk about yet another horrific example of modern slavery, this time with the breaking of a ring of trafficking and abuse of migrant workers in Georgia here in the US. We also cover the recent spate of sickouts, unionizations, strikes, and protests amongst school bus drivers all across the country, as they face paltry wages, chaotic schedules, and few safety protections. Finally, the art world has seen a surge in workplace organizing since the beginning of the pandemic, with visitor staff, creative workers, security guards, and many others uniting to fight back against the massive disparity in pay between the workers that keep museums running and the rich boards that direct them. </p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>We start this week’s episode of Work Stoppage catching up with some of the bigger strikes in the country.  First, Starbucks has pulled out all the stops in its union busting efforts, even bringing in former CEO and failed presidential candidate Howard Schultz to try and convince workers to vote against their union as ballots go out this week. Then we check in on the Kellogg’s strike, where the company has refused to budge on its two-tiered contract system and workers have dug in for the long haul.  Mercy Hospital workers have ended their 5 week long strike after ratifying a new contract that met all their key demands. 3000 student workers at Columbia University have gone on strike again over poverty wages, insufficient healthcare, and unfair grievance procedures. In Germany, 2500 Amazon workers with the Verdi union federation have struck over the company’s refusal to accept the industry standard collective bargaining agreement, while at the same time Amazon has been found to have illegally stolen $60M in tips from Flex drivers.  Finally, 800 teachers in Scranton, PA have struck after four years without a contract after suffering years of austerity budgets and rising class sizes.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>A lot has happened on the John Deere picket lines since we last talked about the strike, so we start there this week.  One UAW worker was tragically killed after being struck by a vehicle walking to their car from the picket line, and the union has turned down Deere’s most recent contract offer after it failed to remove the current two-tiered system.  We also follow up with the organized Netflix workers, who have filed unfair labor practice charges against the company, and Amazon workers in Staten Island have officially filed with the NLRB for a union election.  Also in New York, taxi drivers have been protesting for months, including a recent two week hunger strike and have finally won relief from predatory medallion debts often running well over half a million dollars for many drivers.  UFCW workers recently ended a six week strike at Heaven Hill bourbon distillery but their new contract was actually approved with only a minority of yes votes.  Finally, we’ve got a great example of malicious compliance as UPS drivers in Columbus show up en masse to screw with the company’s exploitative weekend scheduling practices.</p>

<p>As a Labor News show, we talk about unions constantly and how vital they are to building any sort of socialist project. But the labor movement has been around a long time without prompting a revolution, so what should our organizing tactics be if our ultimate goal isn't just slightly better wages and working conditions, but a revolutionary transformation of society? On this patrons-only episode, Dan dives into Lenin's work to dig into the Marxist perspective on union organizing and its relationship to socialist politics. Contrasting the Bolsheviks' orientation on the trade union movement to revolutionary syndicalism and social democratic reformism, Lenin aimed for a dialectical approach to the process of raising working class consciousness both within and without the trade union movement. While acknowledging the different material conditions 100 years later, there's still a lot we can learn as organizers about the difficult balance of agitating within often reformist institutions in order to meet the masses where they are. This review of Lenin's theoretical work on the subject centers on the lessons learned from the long struggle for a unified workers movement and how we can apply them today.</p>

Then we discuss the tragic death of Halyna Hutchins and how everything that led to it demonstrates why the IATSE workers voted so overwhelmingly to strike. Also this week, workers in Italy have rallied to defend the country’s major trade unions after attacks from neo-fascists. Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans staged a one day general strike this week to protest the country’s massive inequality and exploitation of workers. Finally, 36,000 Kaiser Permanente workers have voted to authorize what could be the largest US strike of the year so far.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[

John’s under the weather this week, and Lina and Dan start off with a follow up on the IATSE strike, where a tentative agreement was reached by the bargaining committee over the weekend but may not be ratified when the membership gets to vote. We also check in with Starbucks Workers United as the company has closed two of the stores that had been attempting to unionize, while insisting that it has nothing to do with the union drive. Also this week, Netflix employees plan a walkout after an organizer with the company’s Trans Employee Resource Group was fired in the wake of worker complaints about the handling of the recent Dave Chappelle special. Over 160,000 workers in South Africa’s biggest union are on strike for fairer wages, and threaten to completely shut down the country’s lucrative auto parts industry. The biggest US strike of the year so far is underway as 10,000 UAW workers at John Deere are on the picket lines in three states, and the company is struggling to find enough scabs to keep plants open. Finally, we discuss the announcement of the first union in the tabletop gaming industry, Paizo Workers United.

This week we start with our friends at Doughnut Workers United, where the NLRB recently ruled in their favor that Voodoo Doughnuts illegally fired several of their workers for striking and must rehire them and pay back pay.  Then we discuss the recent car attack on protesting farmers in Lakhimpur, Uttar Pradesh, where four farmers were killed.  One of the biggest strikes in recent memory looms across the US as IATSE voted overwhelmingly to strike after decades of understaffing and an enforced culture of overwork.  Kellogg’s workers are also on strike nationwide facing many of the same issues as Nabisco workers, with the company pushing a two tiered employment system and threatening to cut jobs.  Finally this week, 2000 nurses and hospital workers are on strike in Buffalo, and a factory in Argentina celebrates 20 years of worker control and self-management.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our first story this week is following up with Automobile Mechanics Local 701 in Chicago, where hundreds of mechanics have narrowly agreed to end their 8 week long strike and accept a new contract. Then we discuss a package of reforms passed in New York City to address some of the most egregious aspects of gig work for delivery drivers. We also cover harsh working conditions and intimidation at the El Milagro tortilla company in Chicago, where workers faced a lockout after demanding better treatment. While some listeners may be aware of the often exaggerated claims made by companies about their use of “AI” in the products, this week we cover how often times the work is actually being done by refugees for extremely low wages. This week also saw a huge action by the Indian Farmers’ movement, which shut down transit and commerce across the country in a 10 hour general strike. Finally, in an example of the power of the threat of the strike even on a smaller scale, concessions workers at Oracle Park in San Francisco have been able to force their employer to grant them the fair wages and benefits they deserve.

First we discuss the victory of the Nabisco workers in their 5 week strike and break down the specific wins in their new contract. Then we check in with the workers at Activision Blizzard King who have filed an unfair labor practice charge alleging the company is intimidating workers organizing in the wake of the recent lawsuit and revelations about ABK’s toxic culture. We discuss Verso Books UK dragging out their negotiations with their workers’ union, and also cover a push by developers and contractors to eliminate a needed safety regulation in the NYC construction industry. Also this week, revelations from leaked emails show Google has been underpaying thousands of temporary workers around the world in violation of Pay Parity laws. Finally, the Teamsters have started the process of making good on their pledge to organize Amazon, launching union drives at 9 warehouses in Canada.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>The regular gang is back together this week and we start out discussing the cruel irony of the government allowing unemployment benefits to run out for millions of workers on Labor Day. Also this week, major hotel chains like Marriott and Hilton are using the crisis of the pandemic to consolidate their market position and attacked unionized workforces. We also cover the harsh conditions faced by tobacco pickers here on H2-A visas, as well rampant union busting at a couple of the biggest logistics companies you’ve probably never heard of. Finally, teachers at Oakland University (Michigan not California) responded to demands that they take benefit cuts with a 2 day strike that successfully forced the University back to the bargaining table.

We start out covering the NLRB dismissing complaints from striking Warrior Met coal miners about vehicles striking their picket lines for “lack of evidence” despite numerous videos. Then, we cover a couple international stories with workers in Colombia returning to the streets to protest proposed austerity measures as well as sugarcane farmers in India blocking highways and railroads to win higher purchase prices for their crops from the government. Also this week, after a nearly 5 month delay workers at Colectivo Coffee have won their election to become the largest café workers union in the country, and a new union drive at Starbucks has started with Starbucks Workers United aiming to organized over 20 stores in the Buffalo area. Finally, window washers in Minneapolis have successfully struck for higher wages and state certified safety training for their vital, dangerous jobs.

It’s just John and Dan as Lina is off this week, and we start with a dire warning to never trust a man in a cravat after Nathan J Robinson responded to the staff of Current Affairs’ desire to form a co-op by firing everyone. Then, after a brief check-in with the Teamsters in Indiana who have reached an agreement with Pepsi to end their strike, we hit some of the big news this week as a judge in California has ruled Prop 22 unconstitutional. However, this hasn’t stopped gig companies trying to expand their misclassification schemes across the country as a Prop 22 clone is being pushed in Massachusetts. We also cover a strike by nurses in Worcester, MA that has stretched into its sixth month, as Tenet Healthcare brings in scabs rather than hiring more nurses. Also this week, Nabisco workers across the country are on strike after their parent company Mondelez, enemies of the show, have recently closed two facilities in the US and attempted to force remaining workers to work 12 hours shift or up to 70 consecutive days without paying overtime.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>On this week’s episode of Work Stoppage we start by checking in on the Teamsters strike at a Pepsi plant in Indiana, where workers have gotten a surprising show of support from the local government of the nearby town of Hammond.  Then we take a look at how a Wisconsin healthcare company is giving bonuses only to non-union workers, and discuss a new app called Unit which claims it can help workers unionize without any of the resources of an actual union.  We also cover a walkout by tech workers at the New York Times and the revelations of the Times’ anti-union strategy to try and force as small a bargaining unit as possible.  Finally, we talk about a weeklong strike by contract sanitation workers in India demanding equal pay for equal work, and the inspiring success of workers in Venezuela who seized a Kellogg cereal factory when the company abandoned it.</p>

<p>On the third and final part of our series on the nature of the state, we examine the work of two theorists of the modern capitalist state, Antonio Gramsci and Louis Althusser.  Starting with Gramsci’s understanding of the concept of hegemony, we look at the arms of the state that extend beyond the traditional public sphere, how state ideology influences and is reproduced by “civil society”.  We then go over Althusser’s development of Gramsci’s concepts into his formulation of the arms of the state into two distinct groups, the repressive state apparatuses and the ideological state apparatuses.  Both of these theorists help expand our understanding of how state ideology works even with the “private” sphere to reproduce and reify the ideological superstructure on top of the economic relations of exploitation fundamental to capitalism.  We discuss Gramsci’s imperative for revolutionaries to work to build a counter-hegemony, a new proletarian understanding of how society can be restructured away from capitalist relations of exploitation.  We wrap up with some examples of how this all affects workers organizing on the shop floor, and how a solid understanding of the state reproduces its own ideology can help us build competing models for society, and fight back against capitalist hegemony in all its manifestations.</p>

We’re back to the regular news format this week and it’s a heavy one. First we follow up with the Frito-Lay workers, who have won some concessions from the company after being on strike for almost 3 weeks. Then we cover a major truck drivers’ strike across Puerto Rico that has resulted in a confrontation between the local government and the colonial “oversight board” installed by the US. We also discuss OSHA issuing paltry fines for a liquid nitrogen leak that killed 6 workers at a food processing plant in Georgia, and US politicians doing nothing to prevent the shutdown of one of the largest generic pharmaceutical plants in the US and the loss of its 1500 jobs. The past week has seen a flurry of organizing activity around revelations of major misconduct and a pervasive culture of sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard specifically and across the games industry generally. Finally, we cover California Dr. Pepper workers voting to unionize with the Teamsters, threatening to shut down the whole region’s production if the company doesn’t bargain in good faith.

                      <description><![CDATA[

On this week’s episode of Work Stoppage we were lucky enough to be joined by a guest, Ida Nikou, a PhD student studying labor relations in Iran to discuss the recent strikes among temporary and contract workers in Iran’s oil industry. We learn some of the background on the situation for workers in Iran across various industries, what kinds of unions exist, what level of labor rights (or lack thereof) most workers have in Iran, and generally discuss the parallels and differences between the conditions workers face in both Iran and the US. We go over the specific conditions faced by the oil workers that lead to this wave of strikes and the impact they’ve had in Iran. Finally we discuss the ways US imperialism has exacerbated this situation, and the importance of workers within the US standing against US imperialism in solidarity with workers around the world.

On this week’s episode of Work Stoppage we were lucky enough to be joined by a guest, Ida Nikou, a PhD student studying labor relations in Iran to discuss the recent strikes among temporary and contract workers in Iran’s oil industry. We learn some of the background on the situation for workers in Iran across various industries, what kinds of unions exist, what level of labor rights (or lack thereof) most workers have in Iran, and generally discuss the parallels and differences between the conditions workers face in both Iran and the US. We go over the specific conditions faced by the oil workers that lead to this wave of strikes and the impact they’ve had in Iran. Finally we discuss the ways US imperialism has exacerbated this situation, and the importance of workers within the US standing against US imperialism in solidarity with workers around the world.

On this Overtime episode, the first in a series, John, Lina, and Dan take some time to dig into the fundamentals behind our understandings of the nature of the state: what it is, its historical development, how it functions, and how it can be changed. During this first part of our discussion, Dan takes us through the theoretical work and historical analysis on the state by Marx, Engels, and Lenin, how they defined the state, how they foresaw it being abolished in the future, and how we could get from where we are under the domination of the capitalist ruling class, to a real democracy where workers would have state power instead of a tiny rich ruling class. We talk about how their theories apply today, how we see their historical materialist analysis reflected in the US state today, and why their theories remain vital for workers struggles for control of their own lives.

In the next episode(s) in this series, John will bring in analysis of the state from the Anarchist perspective, and we will take a look at how later theorists like Gramsci and Althusser expand on these concepts based on modern historical developments.</p>

Next we cover some of the evolving tactics the UMWA workers have been using during their ongoing strike at Warrior Met coal, as well as recent revelations that Amazon has been instructing its managers not to tell employees when they’ve been placed on “performance improvement plans” which could result in their termination.  We also cover a week-long strike by workers at the Chicago-based Portillo’s chain, a bizarre dual contract situation at a Pepsi plant in Indiana, and finish up discussing Iceland’s move to a 4 day work week.

                      <description><![CDATA[

On last week’s episode we discussed the recent strike by workers organizing with Doughnut Workers United at Voodoo Doughnuts in Portland during the recent heat wave. This week we were lucky enough to be able to interview one of the workers illegally fired in retaliation for that strike. We discuss the general conditions at Voodoo Doughnuts, the tactics used by management to combat the union drive, and how the company tried to justify its firing of workers for a legally protected strike action over unsafe work conditions.

This week we are joined by @laborkyle as a guest! We start with a follow-up from the Colorado Labor Board on how employers aren't allowed to just put "not hiring in Colorado" on their listings to avoid labor law. We then cover the retaliatory firing of workers for a workplace safety strike at Voodoo Doughnuts, ways in which Trader Joe's is attacking worker rights again, and how Amazon's work conditions are so bad that some of their contractors have had to stop doing business entirely. Finally we end on a strike at a Frito-Lay plant in Tacoma which is also a partial struggle to get democracy in their union, and the repression of Atlanta's Homeless Union by the police.

On this Overtime episode, Dan examines the long, sordid history of collaboration between the leadership of the AFL-CIO and the CIA. Working to enforce the interests of US Empire and the ruling class that controls it, the leadership of the AFL-CIO used the specter of “communist domination” to justify subverting labor movements around the world. Hoping to prevent such betrayal of the global working class in the future, here we look at why this collaboration occurred, who was behind it, and what we can do to make sure that US labor stands in solidarity with workers around the world.

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we start out checking in on the striking Volvo Truck workers in Virginia, who have rejected a corporate-friendly tentative agreement for the second time. We then cover the demise of New York’s proposed bill to create toothless state unions for gig workers after strong opposition from Los Deliveristas Unidos and other unions.  Next, we discuss the success of the AROC/ILWU #BlocktheBoat campaign in Oakland, as well as a proposed resolution from the LA Teachers’ Union calling for an end to US aid to Israel and to support the BDS movement. Then we cover Canada’s postal workers union pushing to transform the postal service into a broader agency capable of meeting more community needs.  Also this week, while the Biden admin gets rosy media coverage, the federal government has continued to award massive contracts to companies using detained migrants as slave labor.  Finally, with the news that Jeff Bezos will be heading into space (hopefully forever), we take a look at the numbers behind his wealth, and how Amazon’s speedup based business model is taking its toll on workers’ bodies. </p>

Then we cover Canada’s postal workers union pushing to transform the postal service into a broader agency capable of meeting more community needs.  Also this week, while the Biden admin gets rosy media coverage, the federal government has continued to award massive contracts to companies using detained migrants as slave labor.  Finally, with the news that Jeff Bezos will be heading into space (hopefully forever), we take a look at the numbers behind his wealth, and how Amazon’s speedup based business model is taking its toll on workers’ bodies. </p>

We start on a happy note, following up on nursing home workers winning their demands and avoiding a strike in Connecticut after the governor had threatened to use the National Guard as scabs. We then move to New York for two stories on gig workers, one covering draft legislation which would force workers into two toothless state-approved unions with no ability to strike, another covering the grassroots organizing efforts of gig workers themselves to fight for better working conditions in NYC. Next we discuss an investigation into the murder by neglect of nearly a dozen migrant workers at a Seneca Foods green bean facility in Wisconsin during the height of the pandemic, and how every level of power, from the company to the legislature to the state OSHA worked together to sacrifice these workers for increased profits. Also this week, the AFL-CIO has announced their long awaited report on how to handle police unions, and finish off with the unionization of 17,000 workers in the University of California system.</p>

<p>On this solo episode, Dan reads several sections from Detroit: I Do Mind Dying, a history of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers, and discusses what we can learn from a criminally under-analyzed movement. The League represented an advanced attempt to unify the class struggle on the shop floor with social struggles in broader society, and a powerful pushback against entrenched bureaucratic business friendly union leadership. The first in a future series of deep dive 'Overtime' episodes into labor history, here we examine what about the League’s practice worked, what didn’t, the historical context in which the movement took place, and what parallels can be drawn to struggles today.</p>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>This week’s episode has a bit of a shuffle as John is busy moving, but Lina and Dan were lucky enough to be joined by special guest Ethan from Invent the Future and Red Game Table!  We start out with a follow-up on the uprising currently happening in Colombia, then move to the governor of Connecticut calling out the National Guard to act as scabs to break a potential strike at nursing homes. Next we discuss an upcoming McDonald’s strike on May 19 for $15/hr, Amazon drivers being forced to choose between driving safely and keeping their jobs, and the nationwide push by the ruling class to end unemployment benefits to force people to work for less than a living wage.  We close out covering workers quitting a Maine Dollar General and calling to overthrow capitalism on the way out.

<p>On this week’s episode, John, Lina, and Dan follow up on a successful union drive at Maine’s largest hospital, and workers at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island working to build an independent union with lessons from the BAmazon drive.  Next, we discuss the president of NYU running to the parents of grad students to complain about them going on strike, and bus drivers going on wildcat strike in Mississippi.  Our main story this week is the ongoing general strike and protests across Colombia over the past week in response to regressive taxes on the working class, the attempted privatization of Colombia’s healthcare system, and violent police repression.  Finally, we applaud In These Times’ call to get rid of no-strike clauses in union contracts.</p>

<p>
This week’s episode starts with an update on the ongoing United Steelworkers strike against ATI in multiple states.  Then John, Lina and Dan discuss a petition by Trader Joe’s workers aimed at making benefits gained during the pandemic permanent, Joe Biden raising the minimum wage for federal contractors and starting a labor task force, and several major unions threatening to withhold funds from Democrats who don’t support the PRO Act. In our main story, we cover the awful working conditions of drivers for Walmart’s gig service, Spark, and how it seems to combine all the worst aspects of the various gig companies into one.  Finally, we close out with an update on the Indian Farmers’ Movement, staying strong five months on.</p>

<p>This week’s episode starts with some more labor history as John, Lina, and Dan discuss a selection from Detroit: I Do Mind Dying, on working conditions in the auto industry in Detroit in the 1970s.  We then get into the week’s labor news discussing a medical marijuana dispensary unionizing in Rhode Island and the proliferation of “Labor Peace Agreements”, a federal judge throwing out a USDA rule allowing meatpacking plants to remove speed limits on pork processing lines, and another protest from inmates at the St Louis County Jail over inhumane conditions and trial delays.  Finally we cover two major strikes, one by 1100 UMWA coal miners in Alabama, the other by 1300 Steelworkers across five states in the Northeast.

<p>Continuing the series on modern slavery we started last week, John, Lina, and Dan follow a recent story on the horrifying working conditions for migrant workers on construction work for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and how they are emblematic of a widespread use of indentured and slave labor in the region. We also follow up on Uber’s attempts to (mis)classify workers as independent contractors facing a rare defeat in the UK, several stories about Amazon’s attempts to undermine the union election at their Bessemer Alabama facility, employer retaliation against organizing janitorial workers in Florida and a hunger strike by inmates at the Louisiana State Penitentiary protesting long term use of solitary confinement.
The hunger-strikers are asking concerned people to call Warden Nettles LSP at 225-655-4411 to demand they be moved from solitary confinement to appropriate, safe conditions.</p>
